            <p>
                I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://cstheory.ucsd.edu/home.html">theory group</a> at UCSD, where I am advised by <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dasgupta/">Sanjoy Dasgupta</a> and <a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~slovett/">Shachar Lovett</a>.
                Before that, I worked at <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a> for three years. I received a BS and MS in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IITD) advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cs1R7C0AAAAJ">Subiman Kundu</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Fall 2019, I was a short term scholar at <a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/sp/Optimization_Statistics_and_Theoretical_Machine_Learning"> Institute for Advanced Study</a>. In Summer 2019, I was a visiting graduate student at <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/dl2019">Simons Institute</a>.

        <p>
            I am currently pursuing research in learning theory. In particular, active learning and reinforcement learning.
