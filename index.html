      <b>The Loss Landscapes of Three-Layered ReLU Networks</b><br>
      Jacek Cyranka, Sicun Gao, Gaurav Mahajan (Alphabetical Order) <br>
      [<a href="">arxiv</a>]<br>
      We prove the existence of infinite sets of spurious local minima in the squared-error loss landscape of three-layered ReLU networks. The local minima form hypersurfaces embedded in unbounded convex regions. We give a complete taxonomy
      of such regions for the smallest ReLU network that exhibits this behavior. We then use the analysis to motivate the design of a boundary-guided gradient descent algorithm that is still guaranteed to converge to global minima in the small network.Finally,
      we prove general theorems about similar hypersurfaces of critical points in arbitrarily large three-layered ReLU networks.
