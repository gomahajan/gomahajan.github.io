  <b>About Me</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  I am currently pursuing theoretical research in active learning and reinforcement learning, and broadly interested in topics related to theoretical machine learning and optimization. In Summer 2019, I was a visiting graduate student at <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/dl2019">Simons Institute</a> and before that, I worked at <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a> for three years. I received a BS and MS in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IITD) advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cs1R7C0AAAAJ">Subiman Kundu</a>. 
  <br>
  <br>
  I am currently at Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton for the Fall 2019.
