  <b>About Me</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  I am currently pursuing theoretical research in reinforcement learning, and broadly interested in topics related to theoretical machine learning and learning theory. I was a visiting student at <a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/sp/Optimization_Statistics_and_Theoretical_Machine_Learning"> Institute for Advanced Study</a> and <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/dl2019">Simons Institute</a> in Fall and Summer 2019. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a> for three years. I received a BS and MS in Mathematics and Computing from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (IITD) advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cs1R7C0AAAAJ">Subiman Kundu</a>.
